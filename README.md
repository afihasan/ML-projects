# ML-projects
# Machine Learning Algorithms Portfolio üìò

This repository contains hands-on implementations of various machine learning algorithms and techniques that I have learned and applied throughout my coursework. The goal is to build a personal portfolio of working ML models which covers both **supervised** and **unsupervised learning** with well-documented notebooks and real-world use cases.

## üìÇ Project Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a different ML topic or algorithm family, with Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the implementation and analysis.

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `01_classification_supervised/` | Notebooks on classification tasks using supervised learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Trees). |
| `02_regression_supervised/`    | Regression-based models (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso). *(Coming soon)* |
| `03_unsupervised_learning/`    | Clustering and dimensionality reduction (e.g., K-Means, PCA). *(Planned)* |
| `04_model_evaluation/`         | Metrics, confusion matrices, cross-validation, etc. *(Planned)* |
| `05_project_apps/`             | End-to-end applications combining multiple ML concepts. *(Future goal)* |

## ‚úÖ Completed So Far

- ‚úÖ Supervised classification on extrovert-vs-introvert-behavior-data using Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree.
- ‚úÖ Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

## üöß Upcoming Work

- Add regression models with both real and synthetic datasets.
- Explore unsupervised algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, and PCA.
- Include detailed explanation on data preprocessing steps (scaling, encoding, imputation).
- Optional: Integrate visualizations using Seaborn and Plotly.
